# OnlineGradeBookMVC

This is the online grade book for classes A, B, C in years 1-3 (for now only 1A and 1B implemented in 100%). You can see all of the students in the class and their contact informations (in separate view)
and their grades avarages. If you go to Grade Avarages you can click on details in every particular subject and then edit avarages for chosen student (you choose it by Id when editting). 
Everything is connected to SQL database by using c# and especially entity framework (everything included in code) and everything is split into particular folders for better code managment.
